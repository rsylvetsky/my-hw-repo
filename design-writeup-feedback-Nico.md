### ***Design Write-up Feedback***

Awesome project! This is a really cool area of research that tons of people are working on. I'll send as much handy resources and guides as I can think of, depending on what path you choose to go down.

***Unsupervised Learning***  
As we discussed previously, our course predominantly covers _supervised_ learning methods. Thus, a lot of this work will be done on your own, with both our help and the fundamentals we teach of course! Just a bit of a heads up.

***Vectors, embeddings, and encoding text***  
Okay, there is a lot to learn here. To begin, of course, always start with one solid method (like TFIDF) and move on from there. But vector embeddings and word2vec is really cool. Word2Vec will take a word and produce a vector for each word. So your tweet will look like an array of vectors that are each a word. What you can do with this is, either, feed it into a model or you can make document vectors, which take in the words and produce a vector for each document! I'll send along some resources, but we can also chat about this during office hours. This is definitely something to look into.

I don't know if you like podcasts, but I do and this is great:

***Plotting clusters***  
There are many methods that you can use to plot these clusters. We can discuss these later once you have gotten a bit further along. **Don't worry about this yet,** but here are two popular methods (the second being more complicated, but preferred):

***Additional data***  
Adding in some engagement data could be very interesting to play with! Sometimes you can encode more information via other sources. I know that spotify, youtube, etc. will include this type of data about their users to perform certain unsupervised tasks.

*Side note: I appreciated the, "Neural Networks (yikes)"*
