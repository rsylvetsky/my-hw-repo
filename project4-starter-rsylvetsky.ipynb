While we explored a linear regression at first, this type of model does not make sense given the admittance's binary 1 or 0 outcome.

    "\n",
    "Looking into the prestige level, there is increasing odds of students being accepted into a graduate program as their prestige of undergrad college goes up. If you attend a Prestige 1 school, you are 4 times as likely to be accepted. By attending a Prestige 2 school, you are half as likely to be admitted than those who didn't attend a Prestige 2 school. By attending a Prestige 3 school, you are about 1/4 as likely to be admitted compared to those in non-Prestige 3 school. Finally, by attending a Prestige 4 school, you are about 1/5 as likely to be admitted compared to those in a non-Prestige 4 school. The takeaway here is that Prestige does indeed play an important predictive role in determining acceptance.\n",
