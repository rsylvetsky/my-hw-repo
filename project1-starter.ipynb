If a score falls 3 times the SD above the mean or 3 times the SD below the mean of the data set, it's considered an outlier."

Then, review the distribution of the sample data by plotting a histogram to confirm that this is a normalized distribution. Once this is confirmed, use the IQR of the distribution to identify any outliers in the data set. Confirm if they are result of a bug or a mistake in the data. For this analysis, you should only remove the outliers when they are a result of human error. Finally, find the correlation among the different variables. If there is a high level of colinearity in the variables, only use one variable for the regression.\n"
