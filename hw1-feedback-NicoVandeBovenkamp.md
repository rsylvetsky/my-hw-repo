### ***Project 1 Feedback***

**Overall:** Good work on this first assignment! Your answers were on-point, and well thought out! Very well done. The one thing, though, is that this homework, and the subsequent homeworks, are intended to be done with the *admissions.csv* data that is in the unit-projects. No worries for this one, your answers were great, but for the next one we are referring to the admissions data.


**Some Notes**

* *Q.3b* Great! Also, as you can see from our lesson, you could use a t-test and infer extremity from there (which is effectively what you were saying, but with a probability associated).
* *Q.4b* Awesome job! That's exactly what we could use. Try play with this! [Seaborn](https://elitedatascience.com/python-seaborn-tutorial) also has a ton of great plots for correlation matrices.

**Something to think about**

KDNuggets has a ton of nice post -- definitely a website to explore if you haven't already. Check out this one for [outlier analysis](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/02/removing-outliers-standard-deviation-python.html) in Python!

***Note: Given you already have some solid exposure to statistical/data analysis, if you ever feel a topic is too elementary or you want more, please ask for some suggestions for more advanced readings! I can send things your way, especially once we get into modeling!***
